Besides, corruption erodes public trust in authorities and the rule of law; when administrative bribery becomes a recurrent experience of large sectors of the population and businesses, its negative effects have an enduring negative impact on the rule of law, democratic processes and justice. By providing a direct measure of the experience of bribery, this indicator provides an objective metric of corruption, a yardstick to monitor progress in the fight against corruption</p>","DATA_COMP":"<p>Proportion of persons who paid at least a bribe (gave a public official money, gift or did a public official favour) to a public official, or were asked for a bribe by these public officials, in the last 12 months, expressed as percentage of persons who had at least one contact with a public official in the same period.</p>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-09-28","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2022-09-28: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-ghana/data/commit/fc2d4b11e414f3d52ede9a374b46859dcef1251b","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_title":"global_indicators.16-5-1-title","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"line","indicator_name":"global_indicators.16-5-1-title","indicator_number":"16.5.1","national_geographical_coverage":"","page_content":"","permalink":"","precision":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"World Bank","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":2004,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"Ghana","source_url_1":"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.DDAY?locations=GB","source_url_text_1":"Poverty headcount ratio at $1.90 a day (2011 PPP) (% of population)","source_release_date_1":"28/05/2020","source_next_release_1":"TBA","source_statistical_classification_1":"Non-official","source_contact_1":"Research@WorldBank.org","source_active_2":false,"source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"indicator":"16.5.1","target_id":"16.5","sdg_goal":"16","indicator_sort_order":"16-05-01"}
