Physical violence consists of acts aimed at physically hurting the victim and include, but are not limited to, acts like pushing, grabbing, twisting the arm, pulling  hair, slapping, kicking, biting or hitting with a fist or object, trying to strangle or suffocate, burning or scalding on purpose, or threatening or attacking with some sort of weapon, gun or knife. </p><p>2. Sexual violence is defined as any sort of harmful or unwanted sexual behavior that is imposed on someone, whether by use of physical force, intimidation or coercion. It includes acts of abusive sexual contact, forced      sexual acts, attempted or completed sexual acts (intercourse) without consent (rape or attempted rape), non-contact acts such as being forced to watch or participate in pornography, etc. In intimate partner relationships, sexual violence is commonly operationally  defined in surveys as: being physically forced to have sexual intercourse, having sexual intercourse out of fear for what the partner might do or through coercion, and/or being forced to so something sexual that the woman considers humiliating or degrading.</p><p>3. Psychological violence consists of any act       that induces fear or emotional distress     . It includes a range of behaviors that encompass acts of emotional abuse such as being frequently humiliated in public, intimidated or having things you care for destroyed, etc. These often coexist with acts of physical and sexual violence by intimate partners. In addition, surveys often measure controlling behaviours (e.g., being kept from seeing family or friends, or from seeking health care without permission). These are also considered acts of psychological abuse      </p><p>For a more detailed definition of physical, sexual and psychological violence against women see <em>Guidelines for Producing Statistics on Violence against Women- Statistical Surveys</em> (UN, 2014), and the <em>International Classification of Crime for Statistical Purposes</em> ICCS (UNODC, 2015), and Violence against Women Prevalence Estimates, 2018.

Slums </strong>\u2013 An expert group meeting was convened in 2002 by UN-Habitat, the United Nations</p><p>Statistics Division and the Cities Alliance to agree on an operational definition for slums to be used</p><p>for measuring the indicator of MDG 7 Target 7.D. The agreed definition classified a <em>\u2018slum household\u2019</em></p><p>as one in which the inhabitants suffer one or more of the following <em>\u2018household deprivations\u2019</em>:</p><p>1. Lack of access to improved water source,</p><p>2. Lack of access to improved sanitation facilities,</p><p>3. Lack of sufficient living area,</p><p>4. Lack of housing durability and,</p><p>5. Lack of security of tenure. By extension, the term <em>\u2018slum dweller\u2019 </em>refers to a person living in</p><p>a household that lacks any of the above attributes.</p><p>1. Access to improved water \u2013 A household is considered to have access to improved drinking</p><p>water if it has sufficient amount of water (20 litres/person/day) for family use, at an</p><p>affordable price (less than 10% of the total household income) and available to household</p><p>members without being subject to extreme effort (less than one hour a day for the minimum sufficient quantity), especially to women and children. An improved drinking water source</p><p>is a facility that is protected from outside contamination, in particular from faecal matters\u2019</p><p>contamination. Improved drinking water sources include: piped water into dwelling, plot or</p><p>yard; public tap/stand pipe serving no more than 5 households; protected spring; rainwater</p><p>collection; bottled water (if secondary source is also improved); bore hole/tube well; and,</p><p>protected dug well.</p><p>2. Access to improved sanitation \u2013 A household is considered to have access to improved</p><p>sanitation if an excreta disposal system, either in the form of a private toilet or a public</p><p>toilet shared with a reasonable number of people, is available to household members. Such</p><p>improved sanitation facilities, therefore, hygienically separates human waste from human</p><p>contact. Improved facilities include: flush/pour-flush toilets or latrines connected to a</p><p>sewer, septic tank or pit; ventilated improved pit latrine; pit latrine with a slab or platform,</p><p>which covers the pit entirely; and, composting toilets/latrines.</p><p>3. Sufficient living area /overcrowding\u2013 A dwelling unit provides sufficient living area for</p><p>the household members if not more than three people share the same habitable room.</p><p>Additional indicators of overcrowding have been proposed: area-level indicators such as</p><p>average in-house living area per person or the number of households per area. Additionally,</p><p>housing-unit level indicators such as the number of persons per bed or the number of</p><p>children under five per room may also be viable</p><p>4. Structural quality/durability of dwellings \u2013 A house is considered as \u2018durable\u2019 if it is built on</p><p>a non-hazardous location and has a permanent and adequate structure able to protect its</p><p>inhabitants from the extremes of climatic conditions such as rain, heat, cold, and humidity.</p><p>The following criteria are used to determine the structural quality/durability of dwellings:</p><p>permanency of structure (permanent building material for the walls, roof and floor;</p><p>compliance with building codes; the dwelling is not in a dilapidated state; the dwelling is</p><p>not in need of major repair); and location of house (hazardous location; the dwelling is not</p><p>located on or near toxic waste; the dwelling is not located in a flood plain; the dwelling is</p><p>not located on a steep slope; the dwelling is not located in a dangerous right of way: rail,</p><p>highway, airport, power lines).</p><p>5. Security of tenure \u2013 Secure tenure is the right of all individuals and groups to effective</p><p>protection by the State against forced evictions. Security of tenure is understood as a set of</p><p>relationships with respect to housing and land, established through statutory or customary</p><p>law or informal or hybrid arrangements, that enables one to live in one\u2019s home with security,</p><p>peace and dignity. Regardless of the type of tenure, all persons with security of tenure have</p><p>a legal status against arbitrary unlawful eviction, harassment and other threats. People have</p><p>secure tenure when: there is evidence of documentation that can be used as proof of secure</p><p>tenure status; and, there is either de facto or perceived protection from forced evictions.</p><p>Important progress has been made to integrate the measurement of this component into</p><p>the computation of the people living in slums.</p><p><strong>b. Informal Settlements </strong>\u2013 Informal settlements are usually seen as synonymous of slums, with a</p><p>particular focus on the formal status of land, structure and services. They are defined by three main</p><p>criteria, according to Habitat III Issue Paper #22, which are already covered in the definition of</p><p>slums. These are:</p><p>1. Inhabitants have no security of tenure vis-\u00e0-vis the land or dwellings they inhabit, with</p><p>modalities ranging from squatting to informal rental housing,</p><p>2. The neighbourhoods usually lack, or are cut off from, formal basic services and city</p><p>infrastructure, and</p><p>3. The housing may not comply with current planning and building regulations, is often</p><p>situated in geographically and environmentally hazardous areas, and may lack a municipal</p><p>permit.</p><p><strong>c. Inadequate Housing </strong>\u2013. For housing to be adequate, it must provide more than four walls</p><p>and a roof, and at a minimum, meet the following criteria:</p><p>1. Legal security of tenure, which guarantees legal protection against forced evictions,</p><p>harassment and other threats;</p><p>2. Availability of services, materials, facilities and infrastructure, including safe drinking</p><p>water, adequate sanitation, energy for cooking, heating, lighting, food storage or refuse</p><p>disposal;</p><p>3. Affordability, as housing is not adequate if its cost threatens or compromises the occupants\u2019</p><p>enjoyment of other human rights;</p><p>4. Habitability, as housing is not adequate if it does not guarantee physical safety or provide</p><p>adequate space, as well as protection against the cold, damp, heat, rain, wind, other threats</p><p>to health and structural hazards;</p><p>5. Accessibility, as housing is not adequate if the specific needs of disadvantaged and</p><p>marginalized groups are not taken into account (such as the poor, people facing</p><p>discrimination; persons with disabilities, victims of natural disasters);</p><p>6. Location, as housing is not adequate if it is cut off from employment opportunities, healthcare</p><p>services, schools, childcare centres and other social facilities, or if located in dangerous</p><p>or polluted sites or in immediate proximity to pollution sources; and</p><p>7. Cultural adequacy, as housing is not adequate if it does not respect and take into account</p><p>the expression of cultural identity and ways of life.</p><p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p><p>People living in adequate homes have better health, higher chances to improve their human capital</p><p>and seize the opportunities available in urban contexts. At the same time, a housing sector that</p><p>performs well acts as a \u2018development multiplier\u2019 benefiting complementary industries, contributing</p><p>to economic development, employment generation, service provision and overall poverty reduction.</p><p>In order to develop a more nuanced definition, there are a number of interrelated terms that must</p><p>be grappled with when considering an indicator for the SDG Target 11.1. They include inadequate</p><p>housing and housing affordability, informal settlements and slums.</p>","SOURCE_TYPE":"<p>Data for the slum/informal settlements components of the indicator can be computed from</p><p>Census and national household surveys, including DHS and MICS. Data for the inadequate</p><p>housing component can be computed through income and household surveys that capture housing</p><p>expenditures.</p>","COLL_METHOD":"<p>Data for the computation of the indicator are collected through censuses and household surveys.</p>","RATIONALE":"<p>From the seven criteria of adequate housing, the three that are not covered by slums / informal</p><p>settlements are affordability, accessibility and cultural adequacy. For the purpose of composing an</p><p>indicator, affordability is the most relevant and easier to measure.</p><p>Thus, in order to come up with a composite indicator, the metadata for the SDG Indicator 11.1.1 is</p><p>proposing to group the definition of slums and informal settlements, to allow for comparison with</p><p>MDGs, and add the element of <em>affordability </em>from the definition of adequate housing.</p><p>Thus, Indicator 11.1.1 is expected to be a <strong>composite one</strong>, with the main components of slum/</p><p>informal settlements\u2019 and the added component of affordability defining inadequate housing.</p>","REC_USE_LIM":"<p>As with all indicators, there are a number of potential challenges and limitations. Some of these are</p><p>outlined below.</p><p>\u2022 Difficulties to agree universally on some definitions and characteristics when referring to</p><p>deteriorated housing conditions, often due to political or economic considerations.</p><p>\u2022 Lack of appropriate tools at national and city levels to measure all components required by</p><p>Indicator 11.1.1, sometimes resulting in the underestimation of deteriorated housing units.</p><p>\u2022 The complicated relation between security of tenure with land and property makes it a</p><p>difficult, but vital, aspect to include in the different surveys, and thus, to measure and</p><p>monitor.</p><p>\u2022 Indicator 11.1.1 does not capture homelessness.</p><p>\u2022 Many countries still have limited capacities for data collection, management and analysis,</p><p>their update and monitoring. These are key to ensure national and global data consistency.</p>","DATA_COMP":"<p>The indicator considers two components to be computed as follows:</p><p>Slum/Informal Settlements Households

The denominator is estimated, using risk mapping and population data.</p>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2021-06-16","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-06-16: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-ghana/data/commit/6eaec674bdcfd8d0adfe0486b5d7a930b8d2bf43","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_title":"global_indicators.3-3-3-title","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"line","indicator_name":"global_indicators.3-3-3-title","indicator_number":"3.3.3","national_geographical_coverage":"","page_content":"","permalink":"","precision":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"indicator":"3.3.3","target_id":"3.3","sdg_goal":"3","indicator_sort_order":"03-03-03"},"14-1-1":{"composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_title":"global_indicators.14-1-1-title","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"line","indicator_name":"global_indicators.14-1-1-title","indicator_number":"14.1.1","national_geographical_coverage":"","page_content":"","permalink":"","precision":[],"reporting_status":"notstarted","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"national_metadata_updated_date":"2021-04-13","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-04-13: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-ghana/data/commit/a089615294020262533c53147dd63adcfa72c6e1","indicator":"14.1.1","target_id":"14.1","sdg_goal":"14","indicator_sort_order":"14-01-01"},"3-3-1":{"SDG_GOAL":"<p>Goal 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.</p>","SDG_TARGET":"<p>Target 3.3: By 2030, end the epidemics of AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and neglected tropical diseases and combat hepatitis, water-borne diseases and other communicable diseases\u00a0</p>","SDG_INDICATOR":"<p>Indicator 3.3.1: Number of new HIV infections per 1,000 uninfected population, by sex, age and key populations </p>","SDG_RELATED_INDICATORS":"<p>Achieving this target will positively impact multiple SDG goals and by reaching other goals will improve countries ability to reduce new HIV infections.

None of the two sources of errros have been fully taken into account for deriving estimates neither at country nor at regional and global levels.   Surveys are carried out in a specific period of the year, usually over a few months. However, this indicator can be affected by seasonality, factors related to food availability (e.g. pre-harvest periods), disease (e.g. rainy season and diarrhoea, malaria, etc.), and  natural disasters and conflicts.

For instance, if the proportion of public spending received by the poor exceeds (falls below) the proportion of poor as defined by national definitions, public expenditures can be interpreted as pro-poor (not pro-poor).

IWRM was officially established in 1992 and is defined as \u201ca process which promotes the coordinated development and management of water, land and related resources in order to maximise economic and social welfare in an equitable manner without compromising the sustainability of vital ecosystems.\u201d (GWP 2010). </p><p>The method builds on official UN IWRM status reporting, from 2008 and 2012, of the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation from the UN World Summit for Sustainable Development (1992).</p><h2>Concepts:</h2><p>The concept of IWRM is measured in 4 main sections, each representing key dimension of IWRM: </p><p>1. Enabling environment: this includes the policies, laws, plans and strategies which create the \u2018enabling environment\u2019 for IWRM. </p><p>2. Institutions and participation: includes the range and roles of political, social, economic and administrative institutions that help to support the implementation of IWRM. </p><p>3. Management Instruments: The tools and activities that enable decision-makers and users to make rational and informed choices between alternative actions. </p><p>4. Financing: Budgeting and financing made available and used for water resources development and management from various sources.</p><p>The indicator is based on a national survey structured around these four main sections. Each section is split into two parts: questions concerning the \u2018National level\u2019 and \u2018Other levels\u2019 respectively. \u2018Other levels\u2019 includes sub-national (including provinces/states for federated countries), basin level, and the transboundary level as appropriate. These two parts address the wording of Target 6.5 \u2018implement [IWRM] at all levels \u2026\u2019.</p>","SOURCE_TYPE":"<h1>Data sources</h1><h2>Description:</h2><p>Monitoring progress on meeting SDG 6.5 is owned by and is the responsibility of the national government. The government will assign a ministry with the primary responsibility for overseeing this survey, which will be asked to take on the responsibility of coordinating the national IWRM monitoring and reporting process. As water management issues cut across a wide number of sectors, often overseen by different ministries and other administrative bodies at national or other levels, the process should be inclusive. Major stakeholders should be involved in order to contribute to well informed and objective answers to the survey. </p><p>The ministry is invited to nominate a national \u201cIWRM focal point\u201d, who may or may not be a government official. The UN will provide support where needed and possible. The following steps are suggested as guidance only, as it is up to countries to decide which process or processes would best serve their needs. It should also be noted that the following steps represent a \u2018ladder\u2019 approach, in that completing all the steps will generally lead to a more robust indicator. However, it may not be possible or necessary for all countries to complete all steps. </p><p>1. The responsible ministry or IWRM focal point contacts other relevant ministries/agencies to compile responses to the questionnaire. Each possible response option has a score which will be used to calculate the overall indicator score.</p><p>2. The completed draft survey is reviewed by government stakeholders. These stakeholders could include those involved in water-relevant sectors, such as agriculture, energy, water supply and environment, as well as water management at different administrative levels. This process may be electronic (e.g. via email) and/or through workshops. </p><p>3. The revised draft survey is validated at a multi-stakeholder workshop. Apart from government representatives these stakeholders could include water user associations, private sector, interest groups concerned with e.g. environment, agriculture, poverty, and academia. The suggested process is through a workshop but alternative means of consultation e.g. email or online call for public submissions could be considered. Note that steps 2 and 3 could be combined if desired. </p><p>4. The responsible ministry or IWRM focal point discusses with relevant officials and consolidates the input into a final version. This version is the basis for calculating the degree of IWRM implementation (0-100) for global reporting. </p><p>5. The responsible ministry submits the final indicator score to the national statistics office responsible for compiling all national SDG target data. </p><p>Based on the national survey, UN-Water will periodically prepare synthesis reports for regional and global levels to provide overall progress on meeting SDG target 6.5. </p><p>Temporal Coverage: A reporting cycle of three years is recommended.</p>","COLL_METHOD":"<h2>Collection process:</h2><p>Official counterparts at the country level oversee the validation and consultation process. </p><p>The survey has been designed so that the indicator is comparable between countries and time periods. No adjustments are foreseen.</p>","FREQ_COLL":"<h1>Calendar</h1><h2>Data collection: </h2><p>January \u2013 May 2020 (5 months). </p>","REL_CAL_POLICY":"<h2>Data release: </h2><p>1st quarter 2021</p>","DATA_SOURCE":"<h1>Data providers</h1><p>The information required to complete the survey is expected to be held by government officials responsible for water resources management in the country, supported by official documentation. E.g. Ministry of Water in coordination with Ministry of Environment, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Planning, Ministry of Lands and Agriculture, Ministry of Industry and Mining etc. See also \u2018data sources\u2019 section above. As a minimum, a small group of officials may be able to complete the survey. However, these government officials may belong to various government authorities, and coordination will be required to determine and validate the responses to each question. Increased government and non-government stakeholder participation in validating the question scores will lead to a more robust indicator score and facilitate tracking progress over time.</p>","COMPILING_ORG":"<h1>Data compilers</h1><p>UNEP and UN-Water partners, under the UN-Water initiative on integrated monitoring of SDG 6.</p>","RATIONALE":"<h2>Rationale:</h2><p>The indicator provides a direct progress measurement of the first part of Target 6.5 \u201c\u2026implement integrated water resources management at all levels \u2026\u201d. The indicator score provides an easy and understandable way of measuring progress towards the target, with \u20180\u2019 interpreted as no implementation of IWRM, and \u2018100\u2019 interpreted as IWRM being fully implemented. </p><p>To further aid interpretation and comparison, the indicator results can be categorized as follows: </p><table><tr><td><p>Degree of implementation</p></td><td><p>Score range</p></td><td><p>General interpretation for overall IWRM score</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Very high</p></td><td><p>91 - 100</p></td><td><p>Vast majority of IWRM elements are fully implemented, with objectives consistently achieved, and plans and programmes periodically assessed and revised.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>High</p></td><td><p>71 - 90</p></td><td><p>IWRM objectives of plans and programmes are generally met, and geographic coverage and stakeholder engagement is generally good.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Medium-high</p></td><td><p>51 - 70</p></td><td><p>Capacity to implement elements of IWRM is generally adequate, and elements are generally being implemented under long-term programmes.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Medium-low</p></td><td><p>31 - 50</p></td><td><p>Elements of IWRM are generally institutionalized, and implementation is underway.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Low</p></td><td><p>11 - 30</p></td><td><p>Implementation of elements of IWRM has generally begun, but with limited uptake across the country, and potentially low engagement of stakeholder groups.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Very low</p></td><td><p>0 - 10</p></td><td><p>Development of elements of IWRM has generally not begun, or has stalled.</p></td></tr></table><p>The concept of the survey is that it provides sufficient information to be of real value to the countries in determining their progress towards the target, and through this, various aspects of IWRM. A balance has been sought between providing sufficient information to cover the core principles of IWRM, and thus providing a robust indicator value, and not overburdening countries with unnecessary reporting requirements. </p><p>Countries are encouraged to provide additional information on each question, which may help to qualify their choice of score, and/or put that score into their national context. </p><p>Indicator 6.5.1 is supported by indicator 6.5.2 \u201cProportion of transboundary basin area with an operational arrangement for water cooperation\u201d, which directly addresses the portion of Target 6.5 \u201c\u2026, including through transboundary cooperation as appropriate.\u201d.</p>","REC_USE_LIM":"<h2>Comments and limitations:</h2><p>The challenge of subjectivity in responses associated with this type of survey is being addressed in a number of ways: </p><ol><li>Draft responses are reviewed by a number of governmental and non-governmental stakeholders in an open, inclusive and transparent process. </li><li>Countries are encouraged to provide further information to qualify their responses and/or set them in the national context. </li><li>Guidelines are provided for each of the four main sections, each question, and each of the six thresholds for every single question, to ensure responses are as objective as possible, and are comparable both between countries, and between reporting periods. </li></ol><p>To achieve robust indicator results requires a country process involving a wide range of stakeholders which will require a certain amount of time and resources. The advantage of this is that it puts in place a process that addresses the integrated and indivisible nature of the SDG targets, as well as stressing the importance of \u201cleaving no on behind\u201d.</p>","DATA_COMP":"<h1>Methodology</h1><h2>Computation method:</h2><p>1.
