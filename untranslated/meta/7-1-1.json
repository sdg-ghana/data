It also incorporates data from the Socio-Economic Database for Latin America and the Caribbean, the Middle East and North Africa Poverty Database, and the Europe and Central Asia Poverty Database, all of which are based on similar surveys. At the time of this analysis, the Global Electrification Database contained 1,282 surveys from 139 countries, excluding surveys from high-income countries as classified by the United. </p>","UNIT_MEASURE":"<p>Percentage (%)</p>","SOURCE_TYPE":"<p>Ghana Living Standards Survey (GLSS) Round 6, 2014; Round, 7, 2019 </p><p>PBB, MoE,2019</p>","DATA_SOURCE":"<p>Ghana Statistical Service (GSS)</p><p>Ministry of Energy (MoE)</p>","COMPILING_ORG":"<p>Ghana Statistical service</p>","RATIONALE":"<p>Access to electricity addresses major critical issues in all the dimensions of sustainable development. The target has a wide range of social and economic impacts, including facilitating development of income generating activities and lightening the burden of household tasks. Under the global target of equal access to energy, SDG7.1.1 focuses specifically on electricity access available to the global population. In order to gain a clear picture, access rates are only considered if the primary source of lighting is the local electricity provider, solar systems, mini-grids and stand-alone systems. Sources such as generators, candles, batteries, etc., are not considered due to their limited working capacities and since they are usually kept as backup sources for lighting.</p>","DATA_COMP":"<p>Number of households having access to electricity divided by the total number of households in the country multiplied by 100</p>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-11-07","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2022-11-07: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-ghana/data/commit/e1106ad55a8a8f3c29f0560b2983765053075052","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"Percent","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":["URBANISATION"],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_title":"global_indicators.7-1-1-title","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"line","indicator_name":"global_indicators.7-1-1-title","target_name":"global_targets.7-1-title","indicator_number":"7.1.1","un_designated_tier":"Tier I","un_custodian_agency":"World Bank (WB)","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-07-01-01.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (PDF 212 KB)","national_geographical_coverage":"","page_content":"","permalink":"","precision":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Energy Commission","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":"","source_geographical_coverage_1":"Ghana","source_url_1":"http://www.energycom.gov.gh/planning/energy-statistics","source_url_text_1":"National Energy Statistics","source_release_date_1":"","source_next_release_1":"TBA","source_statistical_classification_1":"Official","source_contact_1":"statistics@energycom.gov.gh","source_active_2":true,"source_organisation_2":"Ghana Statistical Service (GSS)","source_periodicity_2":null,"source_earliest_available_2":1999,"source_geographical_coverage_2":"Ghana","source_url_2":"https://www2.statsghana.gov.gh/nada/index.php/catalog#_r=1664470556419&collection=&country=&dtype=&from=1960&page=1&ps=&sid=&sk=glss&sort_by=rank&sort_order=desc&to=2015&topic=&view=s&vk=","source_url_text_2":"Ghana Living Standard Survey","source_release_date_2":"","source_next_release_2":"TBA","source_statistical_classification_2":"Official","source_contact_2":"info@statsghana.gov.gh","source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"indicator":"7.1.1","target_id":"7.1","sdg_goal":"7","indicator_sort_order":"07-01-01"}
