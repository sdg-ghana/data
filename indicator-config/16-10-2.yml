  ### Relevant Ghanaian policies


  The [Right to Information Act (ACT 989)](https://www.africanplatform.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Ghana-RTI-Act-__1_.pdf) which was passed in 2019, promotes transparency and accountability by empowering people to access information on central and local governments as well as non-governmental organizations, which are publicly funded.
  
  
  The availability and utilization of information and data is a vital component in efforts to achieve sustainable development. 
  Ghana joined the [open data government partnership](https://www.opengovpartnership.org/open-data/) in 2011 before passing the Right to Information (RTI) bill, which identified open data as a focus area in order to achieve transparent and accountable governance and create a community of data suppliers and users. 
  The RTI's passing is a positive development that will strengthen the nation's open data movement.
