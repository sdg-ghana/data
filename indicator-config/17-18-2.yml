  **Relevant Ghanaian policies**


  The need to improve the legal framework to reflect changes in the statistics landscape worldwide resulted in the promulgation of the [Statistical Service Act, 2019 (Act 1003)](https://statsghana.gov.gh/gssmain/storage/img/STATISTICAL%20SERVICE%20ACT,%202019%20(ACT%201003).pdf).
  The Act which replaces the [Statistical Service Law, 1985](https://www.statsghana.gov.gh/gssmain/storage/img/Statistical%20Service%20Law%20PNDC%20Law%201985.pdf) establishes the [Ghana Statistical Service](https://www.statsghana.gov.gh/) as the central statistics producing and coordinating institution for the National Statistical System to strengthen the production of quality, relevant, accurate, and timely statistical information for the purpose of national development.
  

  In addition, in line with with the fundamental principles of Official Statistics, the understanding and collection of statistics of all statistical departments of Ministries, Departments and Agencies has been enhanced through the implementation of the [National Statistical Development Plan](https://statsghana.gov.gh/gssmain/storage/img/NSDS%20II%20Ghana_Revised_16.03.18.pdf).


  Statistical departments have also been established at the local level, to help improve and ensure conformity of data generated to the principles of official statistics in line with the [Local Governance Act, 2016 (Act 936)](https://lgs.gov.gh/local-governance-act-of-2016-act-936/).
