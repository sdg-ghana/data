  **Relevant Ghanaian policies**


  - The [National Strategy for the Development of Statistics (NSDS) 2018‐2022](https://statsghana.gov.gh/gssmain/storage/img/NSDS%20II%20Ghana_Revised_16.03.18.pdf) is a comprehensive strategic document which seeks to guide the evolution of the National Statistical System (NSS) to enable it to produce the statistical knowledge the country needs to fulfil its development potential. This NSDS is primarily concerned with setting a vision for years (2018‐ 2022) and providing milestones that the NSS must reach to make that vision a reality. This strategy seeks to create a system which is capable of being responsive to users’ needs by providing a basis for results‐oriented strategic management of the NSS and acting as a framework to mobilise and manage resources. This  National Strategy for the Development of Statistics (NSDS) 2018‐2022 is being funded by the [Harmonizing and Improving Statistics in West Africa Project (HISWAP)](https://policycommons.net/artifacts/1805523/ghana/2538215/).
  
  - The last National Strategy for the Development of Statistics, Ghana Statistical Development Programme (2010 – 2013), received funding support from the [Ghana Statistical Development Project (GSDP)](https://www2.statsghana.gov.gh/docfiles/Reports/mdtf_annual_report_2012.pdf) , courtesy of the World Bank, United Kingdom’s Department for International Development (DFID) and other external partners.
