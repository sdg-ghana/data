It does this by providing further information to countries on the context and possible explanation for the progress on other targets, and points to barriers and enablers to obtaining the other targets. It also directly supports the means of implementation targets 6.a and 6.b, as disaggregation is possible to provide data on financing (6.a) and stakeholder participation (6.b). Beyond SDG 6, indicator 6.5.1 has linkages with a number of other targets across the SDGs, as integrated water resources management is concerned with integrating the demands and impacts on water resources and water-related ecosystems from a number of different SDGs and their targets, including: poverty (1.4); agriculture (2.3); education (4.7); gender (5.5); energy (7.1); work (8.5); equality (10.2); urban areas (11.3); climate change (13.2); ecosystems (15.9); governance (16.3, 16.5 \u2013 16.7) (UN-Water 2016).</p>","SDG_CUSTODIAN_AGENCIES":"<h1>Institutional information</h1><h2>Organization(s):</h2><p>United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)</p>","STAT_CONC_DEF":"<h1>Concepts and definitions</h1><h2>Definition:</h2><p>Indicator 6.5.1 is \u2018degree of integrated water resources management implementation (0-100)\u2019. It measures the stages of development and implementation of Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM), on a scale of 0 to 100, in six categories (see Rationale section). The indicator score is calculated from a country survey with 33 questions, with each question scored on the same scale of 0-100.  </p><p>The definition of IWRM is based on an internationally agreed definition, and is universally applicable. IWRM was officially established in 1992 and is defined as \u201ca process which promotes the coordinated development and management of water, land and related resources in order to maximise economic and social welfare in an equitable manner without compromising the sustainability of vital ecosystems.\u201d (GWP 2010). </p><p>The method builds on official UN IWRM status reporting, from 2008 and 2012, of the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation from the UN World Summit for Sustainable Development (1992).</p><h2>Concepts:</h2><p>The concept of IWRM is measured in 4 main sections, each representing key dimension of IWRM: </p><p>1. Enabling environment: this includes the policies, laws, plans and strategies which create the \u2018enabling environment\u2019 for IWRM. </p><p>2. Institutions and participation: includes the range and roles of political, social, economic and administrative institutions that help to support the implementation of IWRM. </p><p>3. Management Instruments: The tools and activities that enable decision-makers and users to make rational and informed choices between alternative actions. </p><p>4. Financing: Budgeting and financing made available and used for water resources development and management from various sources.</p><p>The indicator is based on a national survey structured around these four main sections. Each section is split into two parts: questions concerning the \u2018National level\u2019 and \u2018Other levels\u2019 respectively. \u2018Other levels\u2019 includes sub-national (including provinces/states for federated countries), basin level, and the transboundary level as appropriate. These two parts address the wording of Target 6.5 \u2018implement [IWRM] at all levels \u2026\u2019.</p>","SOURCE_TYPE":"<h1>Data sources</h1><h2>Description:</h2><p>Monitoring progress on meeting SDG 6.5 is owned by and is the responsibility of the national government. The government will assign a ministry with the primary responsibility for overseeing this survey, which will be asked to take on the responsibility of coordinating the national IWRM monitoring and reporting process. As water management issues cut across a wide number of sectors, often overseen by different ministries and other administrative bodies at national or other levels, the process should be inclusive. Major stakeholders should be involved in order to contribute to well informed and objective answers to the survey. </p><p>The ministry is invited to nominate a national \u201cIWRM focal point\u201d, who may or may not be a government official. The UN will provide support where needed and possible. The following steps are suggested as guidance only, as it is up to countries to decide which process or processes would best serve their needs. It should also be noted that the following steps represent a \u2018ladder\u2019 approach, in that completing all the steps will generally lead to a more robust indicator. However, it may not be possible or necessary for all countries to complete all steps. </p><p>1. The responsible ministry or IWRM focal point contacts other relevant ministries/agencies to compile responses to the questionnaire. Each possible response option has a score which will be used to calculate the overall indicator score.</p><p>2. The completed draft survey is reviewed by government stakeholders. These stakeholders could include those involved in water-relevant sectors, such as agriculture, energy, water supply and environment, as well as water management at different administrative levels. This process may be electronic (e.g. via email) and/or through workshops. </p><p>3. The revised draft survey is validated at a multi-stakeholder workshop. Apart from government representatives these stakeholders could include water user associations, private sector, interest groups concerned with e.g. environment, agriculture, poverty, and academia. The suggested process is through a workshop but alternative means of consultation e.g. email or online call for public submissions could be considered. Note that steps 2 and 3 could be combined if desired. </p><p>4. The responsible ministry or IWRM focal point discusses with relevant officials and consolidates the input into a final version. This version is the basis for calculating the degree of IWRM implementation (0-100) for global reporting. </p><p>5. The responsible ministry submits the final indicator score to the national statistics office responsible for compiling all national SDG target data. </p><p>Based on the national survey, UN-Water will periodically prepare synthesis reports for regional and global levels to provide overall progress on meeting SDG target 6.5. </p><p>Temporal Coverage: A reporting cycle of three years is recommended.</p>","COLL_METHOD":"<h2>Collection process:</h2><p>Official counterparts at the country level oversee the validation and consultation process. </p><p>The survey has been designed so that the indicator is comparable between countries and time periods. No adjustments are foreseen.</p>","FREQ_COLL":"<h1>Calendar</h1><h2>Data collection: </h2><p>January \u2013 May 2020 (5 months). </p>","REL_CAL_POLICY":"<h2>Data release: </h2><p>1st quarter 2021</p>","DATA_SOURCE":"<h1>Data providers</h1><p>The information required to complete the survey is expected to be held by government officials responsible for water resources management in the country, supported by official documentation. E.g. Ministry of Water in coordination with Ministry of Environment, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Planning, Ministry of Lands and Agriculture, Ministry of Industry and Mining etc. See also \u2018data sources\u2019 section above. As a minimum, a small group of officials may be able to complete the survey. However, these government officials may belong to various government authorities, and coordination will be required to determine and validate the responses to each question. Increased government and non-government stakeholder participation in validating the question scores will lead to a more robust indicator score and facilitate tracking progress over time.</p>","COMPILING_ORG":"<h1>Data compilers</h1><p>UNEP and UN-Water partners, under the UN-Water initiative on integrated monitoring of SDG 6.</p>","RATIONALE":"<h2>Rationale:</h2><p>The indicator provides a direct progress measurement of the first part of Target 6.5 \u201c\u2026implement integrated water resources management at all levels \u2026\u201d. The indicator score provides an easy and understandable way of measuring progress towards the target, with \u20180\u2019 interpreted as no implementation of IWRM, and \u2018100\u2019 interpreted as IWRM being fully implemented. </p><p>To further aid interpretation and comparison, the indicator results can be categorized as follows: </p><table><tr><td><p>Degree of implementation</p></td><td><p>Score range</p></td><td><p>General interpretation for overall IWRM score</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Very high</p></td><td><p>91 - 100</p></td><td><p>Vast majority of IWRM elements are fully implemented, with objectives consistently achieved, and plans and programmes periodically assessed and revised.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>High</p></td><td><p>71 - 90</p></td><td><p>IWRM objectives of plans and programmes are generally met, and geographic coverage and stakeholder engagement is generally good.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Medium-high</p></td><td><p>51 - 70</p></td><td><p>Capacity to implement elements of IWRM is generally adequate, and elements are generally being implemented under long-term programmes.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Medium-low</p></td><td><p>31 - 50</p></td><td><p>Elements of IWRM are generally institutionalized, and implementation is underway.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Low</p></td><td><p>11 - 30</p></td><td><p>Implementation of elements of IWRM has generally begun, but with limited uptake across the country, and potentially low engagement of stakeholder groups.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Very low</p></td><td><p>0 - 10</p></td><td><p>Development of elements of IWRM has generally not begun, or has stalled.</p></td></tr></table><p>The concept of the survey is that it provides sufficient information to be of real value to the countries in determining their progress towards the target, and through this, various aspects of IWRM. A balance has been sought between providing sufficient information to cover the core principles of IWRM, and thus providing a robust indicator value, and not overburdening countries with unnecessary reporting requirements. </p><p>Countries are encouraged to provide additional information on each question, which may help to qualify their choice of score, and/or put that score into their national context. </p><p>Indicator 6.5.1 is supported by indicator 6.5.2 \u201cProportion of transboundary basin area with an operational arrangement for water cooperation\u201d, which directly addresses the portion of Target 6.5 \u201c\u2026, including through transboundary cooperation as appropriate.\u201d.</p>","REC_USE_LIM":"<h2>Comments and limitations:</h2><p>The challenge of subjectivity in responses associated with this type of survey is being addressed in a number of ways: </p><ol><li>Draft responses are reviewed by a number of governmental and non-governmental stakeholders in an open, inclusive and transparent process. </li><li>Countries are encouraged to provide further information to qualify their responses and/or set them in the national context. </li><li>Guidelines are provided for each of the four main sections, each question, and each of the six thresholds for every single question, to ensure responses are as objective as possible, and are comparable both between countries, and between reporting periods. </li></ol><p>To achieve robust indicator results requires a country process involving a wide range of stakeholders which will require a certain amount of time and resources. The advantage of this is that it puts in place a process that addresses the integrated and indivisible nature of the SDG targets, as well as stressing the importance of \u201cleaving no on behind\u201d.</p>","DATA_COMP":"<h1>Methodology</h1><h2>Computation method:</h2><p>1. The survey contains 33 questions divided into the four main sections described above. </p><p>2. Each question is given a score between 0 and 100, in increments of 10, guided by threshold descriptions for the following 6 categories:</p><ul><li>Very low (0)</li><li>Low (20)</li><li>Medium-low (40)</li><li>Medium-high (60)</li><li>High (80)</li><li>Very high (100)</li></ul><p>Note that guidance is provided for each threshold for each question, to ensure objective and comparable results. </p><p>3. The un-weighted average of the question scores within each of the four sections is calculated to give a score of 0 \u2013 100 for each section, rounded to the nearest whole number. </p><p>4. The section scores (rounded to the nearest whole number), are averaged (un-weighted), and rounded to the nearest whole number, to give the indicator score, expressed as a number between 0 and 100.</p>","IMPUTATION":"<h2>Treatment of missing values:</h2><ul><li><strong><em>At country level:</em></strong></li></ul><p>The indicator and survey have been designed for all countries to be able to submit an indicator value. A number of countries that did not submit a survey during the last round of data collection included fragile states / countries in conflict, or small island developing states.
