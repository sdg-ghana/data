It depicts the risk of maternal death relative to the number of live births and essentially captures the risk of death in a single pregnancy or a single live birth. Maternal deaths: The annual number of female deaths from any cause related to or aggravated by pregnancy or its management (excluding accidental or incidental causes) during pregnancy and childbirth or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy, expressed per 100,000 live births, for a specified time period.</p><p>1) Institutional maternal mortality number of maternal deaths occurring in health facilities per 100, 000 live births, the estimate from survey represents on maternal deaths occurrences recorded at health facilities and other per 100,000 live births. </p><p>2) Maternal mortality ratio (from survey) is the number of maternal deaths per 100,000 live births. Maternal deaths are any deaths that occurs during pregnancy or childbirth or within 42 days after the birth of a child or termination of pregnancy.
